# Svbstrate
### A simple, scalable CSS base layer.

This isn't a framework *per se*, it's more of a CSS methodology, and it's simply my take on other people's ideas. It's based mostly off the fantastic work of Brent Jackson (@jxnblk) and Adam Morse (@mrmrs), and their own CSS frameworks, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), with h/t to Harry Roberts (@csswizardry) and the BEM syntax.

## Getting Started
```
npm i svbstrate
```

## Why
1. It's easier for CSS developers of all skill levels to write clean, maintainable CSS.
2. It's hard to break. Use light-weight classes to target changes at a granular level, and to build more complex components.
3. It's DRY. Stop writing the same properties again and again. Use classes and the cascade to their full potential.
